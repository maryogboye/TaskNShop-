## What TaskNShop Does
**TaskNShop** is a mobile app that connects people who need something bought with trusted local personal shoppers.  
Instead of spending time searching stores, cities, or websites, a user describes the item (or uploads a photo), **TaskNShop** finds a nearby verified shopper, and that shopper goes to the market or store, buys the item, and delivers it — while keeping the user updated in real time.

## Why It Matters
Modern life is busy. People travel, work long hours, or live far from local markets, yet still need everyday items, gifts, or hard-to-find local products.  
Traditional delivery services often fail when:

- Items aren’t available,
- A specific brand or variant is required, or
- Human judgment is needed for selection.

**TaskNShop** fills this gap by using *real human shoppers*. A verified local shopper sources the exact item, negotiates when needed, and provides photos and options in real time.  
This increases success rates, reduces stress, and brings **convenience and trust** back into shopping.
